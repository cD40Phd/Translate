Importing matplotlib and pyplot

Pyplot is a collection of functions in the popular visualization package Matplotlib. Its functions manipulate elements of a figure, such as creating a figure, creating a plotting area, plotting lines, adding plot labels, etc. Let's use the plot() function from pyplot to create a dashed line graph showing the growth of a company's stock. Remember, you can change the color of the line by adding the argument color and the linestlye by adding the argument linestyle.

Two lists, days (representing the days since the company became public), and prices (representing the price of the stock corresponding to that day) are available in your workspace.
